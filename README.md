## React JS Clock Lab

Remember our [JS Clock Intervals deliverable](https://github.com/WDI-SEA/js-clock-intervals-exercise/tree/main) from earlier in the cohort? We will be turning this vanilla JS app into a React app. 

## Getting Started
* Fork and clone this repository and look through the given components, images, and css in `index.css`. 

* Feel free to reference your [original JS Clock and Intervals solution](https://github.com/WDI-SEA/js-clock-intervals-exercise/tree/main), or one of the solution branches, in building out your JS clock application. 

* Get started by defining all possible variables you will need, and then determine which, if any variables should be set using `useState`, and which should be done in `useEffect`. 

Your final application should be a copy of the working JS clock, but built in React using the `useEffect` and `useState` hooks.
